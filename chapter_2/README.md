# Guessing Game
## Instructions from the book
The program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.

### Run

##### Powershell (Windows)

```powershell
cd .\guessing_game\

cargo build

.\target\debug\guessing_game.exe
```
